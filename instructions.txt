Project cleanup and simplification complete.
Your application is now streamlined to use the more reliable Python server.

To run your media controller, follow these steps:

1. Install the required Python libraries:
   pip install -r requirements.txt

2. Run the server:
   python media_control_server.py

3. Find your computer's IP address. You can do this by opening Command Prompt and typing 'ipconfig'.

4. On your Android device, open a web browser and go to: http://<YOUR_PC_IP>:3000
   (replace <YOUR_PC_IP> with the address from the previous step).

A system tray icon will appear for the server. You can right-click it and select 'Quit' to stop the server.

Firewall Note: The first time you run the server, Windows Defender Firewall might ask for permission. Make sure to allow access, especially for private networks.
