# PC Web Remote

A simple, lightweight web server to control your Windows PC's media playback from any device on your local network, like your phone.

This project uses a Python server and the powerful `nircmd.exe` utility to simulate media key presses, offering a reliable way to manage playback without installing any apps on your remote device‚Äîall you need is a web browser.

## Features
- ‚èØÔ∏è **Play/Pause:** Control media playback.
- üîä **Volume Control:** Turn the system volume up or down.
- ‚è™‚è© **Seek:** Go backward or forward by 5-second intervals.
- üñ•Ô∏è **System Tray Icon:** The server runs quietly in the system tray and can be closed from there.

## How It Works
The application runs a Flask web server on your PC. When you press a button on the web interface from your phone, it sends a request to the server. The server then uses the bundled `nircmd.exe` utility to execute the corresponding command, such as 'volume up' or 'press left arrow key'.

## Setup and Usage
Follow these steps to get your remote control running:

**1. Prerequisites:**
- Make sure you have Python installed on your Windows PC. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

**2. Download the Project:**
- You can clone this repository or download the source code as a ZIP file and extract it.

**3. Install Dependencies:**
- Open a command prompt or terminal in the project directory and run the following command to install the required Python libraries:
  ```
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

**4. Run the Server:**
- Double-click the `media_control_server.py` file or run the following command in the terminal:
  ```
  python media_control_server.py
  ```
- The first time you run it, your Windows Firewall may ask for permission. **Allow access**, especially for "Private networks," so your phone can connect to the server.

**5. Connect From Your Phone:**
- Find your PC's local IP address. You can do this by opening a Command Prompt and typing `ipconfig`. Look for the "IPv4 Address."
- Open a web browser on your phone and navigate to `http://<YOUR_PC_IP>:3000` (e.g., `http://192.168.1.10:3000`).
- You should now see the remote control interface.

## Important Usage Notes
- **Window Focus for Seeking:** For the "Backward 5s" and "Forward 5s" buttons to work, the media application (e.g., VLC, your web browser with YouTube) **must be the active, focused window** on your PC. This is because these buttons simulate the left and right arrow key presses.
- **Compatibility:** This application has been tested on **Windows 11** with the following applications:
  - VLC Media Player
  - YouTube (in Brave)
  - JioCinema (in Brave)
